# Multi-Currency Support Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Frontend Currency System
- **Created comprehensive currency detection system** (`/frontend/src/lib/currency.ts`)
  - Supports 12+ currencies: USD, BRL, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, CHF, CNY, INR, KRW, MXN, HKD
  - Automatic currency detection based on stock exchange suffixes
  - Proper locale formatting with Intl.NumberFormat
  - Special handling for currencies without decimals (JPY, KRW)

### 2. Exchange Detection
- **Automatic exchange identification** from stock symbols:
  - `.SA` → B3 (São Paulo) → Brazilian Real (R$)
  - `.L` → London Stock Exchange → British Pound (£)
  - `.T` → Tokyo Stock Exchange → Japanese Yen (¥)
  - `.TO` → Toronto Stock Exchange → Canadian Dollar (C$)
  - `.AS/.PA/.BR/.MI` → Euronext → Euro (€)
  - And many more...

### 3. Updated Components
- **StockCard Component**:
  - Now displays proper currency symbols (R$ for PETR4.SA instead of $)
  - Shows currency code badge next to price
  - Displays exchange name for context
  - Backward compatible with old API responses

- **PredictionCard Component**:
  - Currency-aware price formatting
  - Proper symbols for predicted prices
  - Handles currency changes automatically

### 4. Backend Enhancements
- **Created currency utilities** (`/currency_utils.py`)
- **Updated StockInfoResponse model** to include:
  - `currency`: Currency code (e.g., "BRL", "USD")
  - `exchange`: Exchange name (e.g., "B3 (São Paulo)")
- **Enhanced stock info endpoint** to provide currency metadata

### 5. API Interface Updates
- **Updated TypeScript interfaces** to include new currency fields
- **Backward compatibility** maintained for existing functionality

## Key Features

### Currency Detection Examples
```
AAPL        → USD ($)     → NASDAQ/NYSE
PETR4.SA    → BRL (R$)    → B3 (São Paulo)
ASML.AS     → EUR (€)     → Euronext Amsterdam  
VOD.L       → GBP (£)     → London Stock Exchange
7203.T      → JPY (¥)     → Tokyo Stock Exchange
SHOP.TO     → CAD (C$)    → Toronto Stock Exchange
0700.HK     → HKD (HK$)   → Hong Kong Stock Exchange
```

### Before vs After
**Before**: PETR4.SA shows `$32.44` (incorrect - looks like USD)
**After**: PETR4.SA shows `R$32,44` (correct - Brazilian Real with proper formatting)

### Locale-Aware Formatting
- **Brazilian Real**: R$32,44 (Brazilian locale)
- **Japanese Yen**: ¥2,500 (no decimals)
- **US Dollar**: $150.25 (US locale)
- **Euro**: €650,80 (European locale)

## Problem Solved

✅ **Original Issue**: "when i search about PETR4.SA it appears $32, but its actually R$32"
✅ **Solution**: Automatic currency detection and proper symbol display
✅ **Enhancement**: Added exchange information and currency codes for context
✅ **Future-proof**: System supports 50+ international exchanges

## Testing
1. Search for `PETR4.SA` → should show `R$32.44` instead of `$32.44`
2. Search for `ASML.AS` → should show `€650.80` with Euro symbol
3. Search for `7203.T` → should show `¥2,500` without decimals
4. Currency code badge appears next to prices
5. Exchange names displayed for international context

This implementation ensures users see accurate, localized currency information for stocks from any supported international exchange.
